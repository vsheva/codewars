/*
Create a function close_compare that accepts 3 parameters: a, b, and an optional margin. The function should return whether a is lower than, close to, or higher than b.

    Please note the following:

    When a is close to b, return 0.
For this challenge, a is considered "close to" b if margin is greater than or equal to the absolute distance between a and b.
    Otherwise...

When a is less than b, return -1.

When a is greater than b, return 1.

If margin is not given, treat it as if it were zero.

    Assume: margin >= 0

Tip: Some languages have a way to make parameters optional.
*/

function closeCompare(a, b, margin=0){

    if(a<b-margin) return -1;
    if(a-margin>b) return -1;
    return 0;
}
